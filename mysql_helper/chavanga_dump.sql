This is a territory \nof  ‘’Belomorska’’ tundra. There is no blazed road, on the coast there is more or less \nappreciable track, on seacoast, through the rocks approaching directly to the \nsea. Time in a way approximately 3 hours by off-road-car. The variant with a \npowerboat is more comfortable, it goes to Chavanga less than hour, but it depends\n on the sea condition, which is really important. Because of the hard connectivity to the river\nthere is a minimum amount of people fishing there which is make our fishing trip as good as we dreamt about it. \n</p>\n<p class=\'fishing_main_text\'>\nIn the mouth of the river there is a village with the same name as river, there is also a mail and a shop. The river of the average sizes, a water level, as well as on other rivers, \ndepends on a season and weather. The spring high water happens considerable \nenough, the water level rises about 100cm and above. In the middle of summer and in \nthe autumn all depends on weather, level fluctuates depending on passing rains. \nThe herd of salmon has not suffered yet from fishing pressure. The average \nsize of a salmon here is 3-4 kg. It is conditionally possible to allocate 3 streams of  \nsalmon, spring in May - June, less intensive summer and autumn course from \nsecond half of September. The great bulk of spring salmon is made by fishes of \naverage weight, from 3 kg and above. But often there are big examples of 5-6 kg. \nThe fish of 7-8 kg, basically concern autumn or early spring calling. \n</p>\n<p class=\'fishing_main_text\'>\nIn Chavanga there is a big chance to catch a good trout as well. There are 2 forms - \na through passage and settled trout. Depending on a season and a fishing place \none of these forms prevails. A good trout Trophy you can catch is around 2.5-3 \nkg. Chavanga is one of the best rivers of southern coast on population of graylings. \nThis fish meets from the moment of a descent of ice and till global icing in late autumn. The \nstandard size is 40-48 cm. Grayling more than 50 cm are not so rare as well. \n</p>\n<p class=\'fishing_main_text\'>\nThe river is unique, available and convenient for fly fishing during whole season.  The total length of the river to the falls is 17 km and each part is accessible and interesting for fishing. Conditionally, the character of the river can be divided into 3 parts. \n</p>\n<p class=\'fishing_main_text\'>\n<b>1st part</b> begins from the sea, passes a number of rocky exits and falls, leaves on an extensive reach and proceeds in a twisting stony bed. Total length of the first site is 6 km. \n This is a good place for fishing in the first half of season, in June and the \nbeginning of July, and also in the end of a season, in second half of September, \nwhen it is calling fresh salmon from the sea. The beginning of the river  is very interesting \nfor fishing a through passage trout, especially in the second half of summer and \nin the autumn. Above small falls is a excellent places for grayling fly fishing, the best time \nis the first half of season. \n</p>\n<p class=\'fishing_main_text\'>\n<b>2nd part</b> is located above, has more flat character. Its length is also around 6-7 km. Flat coast are convenient for fishing during the periods of high water. Here it is a lot of places for spawning and  salmon remains all season.

The\npopularity is very famous among fisherman in the whole world. The chance\nof catching the fish is extremely high. The season begins early, right after an ice drift \nin May and proceeds to the late fall. Spinning catching is allowed , but the \npreference is given to the fly fishing. As well as other rivers, Varzuga are \nchanged by the character depending on a season. The end of May, right after an \nice descent, is marked by intensive calling of a fresh sea salmon. At a high \nwater level some advantages has spinning fishing as well. Fish attacks baits very \nactively and this attracts many fishermans. By the end of June water in the \nriver falls, catching becomes more conveniently because activity of fish is \ndecreasing a little. In many respects the water level depends on weather. Fishing \nis organized by a principle: caught and released. Special licence sites are organized \non the banks of the rivers to make your fishing easier. Except salmon there is \ngrayling, corigonus and a trout. Accommodation is offered in the house of the \nfisherman which is in the village Varzuga located on both river banks in 17 km\n from the sea.
