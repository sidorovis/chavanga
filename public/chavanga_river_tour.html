The tour description.<br/>
Salmon fishing in Russia. Kola Peninsula.<br/>

Chavanga it is the river of a southeast part of Kola peninsula, it runs into the White sea in 60 km on the east from the mouth of Varzuga river. This is a territory of ‘’Belomorska’’ tundra. There is no blazed road, on the coast there is more or less appreciable track, on seacoast, through the rocks approaching directly to the sea. Time in a way approximately 3 hours by off-road-car. The variant with a powerboat is more comfortable, it goes to Chavanga less than hour, but it depends on the sea condition, which is really important. Because of the hard connectivity to the river there is a minimum amount of people fishing there which is make our fishing trip as good as we dreamt about it.
<br/>
In the mouth of the river there is a village with the same name as river, there is also a mail and a shop. The river of the average sizes, a water level, as well as on other rivers, depends on a season and weather. The spring high water happens considerable enough, the water level rises about 100cm and above. In the middle of summer and in the autumn all depends on weather, level fluctuates depending on passing rains. The herd of salmon has not suffered yet from fishing pressure. The average size of a salmon here is 3-4 kg. It is conditionally possible to allocate 3 streams of salmon, spring in May - June, less intensive summer and autumn course from second half of September. The great bulk of spring salmon is made by fishes of average weight, from 3 kg and above. But often there are big examples of 5-6 kg. The fish of 7-8 kg, basically concern autumn or early spring calling.
<br/>
In Chavanga there is a big chance to catch a good trout as well. There are 2 forms - a through passage and settled trout. Depending on a season and a fishing place one of these forms prevails. A good trout Trophy you can catch is around 2.5-3 kg. Chavanga is one of the best rivers of southern coast on population of graylings. This fish meets from the moment of a descent of ice and till global icing in late autumn. The standard size is 40-48 cm. Grayling more than 50 cm are not so rare as well.
<br/>
The river is unique, available and convenient for fly fishing during whole season. The total length of the river to the falls is 17 km and each part is accessible and interesting for fishing. Conditionally, the character of the river can be divided into 3 parts.
<br/>
1st part begins from the sea, passes a number of rocky exits and falls, leaves on an extensive reach and proceeds in a twisting stony bed. Total length of the first site is 6 km. This is a good place for fishing in the first half of season, in June and the beginning of July, and also in the end of a season, in second half of September, when it is calling fresh salmon from the sea. The beginning of the river is very interesting for fishing a through passage trout, especially in the second half of summer and in the autumn. Above small falls is a excellent places for grayling fly fishing, the best time is the first half of season.
<br/>
2nd part is located above, has more flat character. Its length is also around 6-7 km. Flat coast are convenient for fishing during the periods of high water. Here it is a lot of places for spawning and salmon remains all season. During the big water lots of trout and grayling crowding together and becomes really active at this time, and its makes our fishing very exciting.
<br/>
3rd site gradually enters into a rocky canyon with the high coast which have grown with the forest. Here the river comes to an end, because of a big falls which is too high for salmon. It is the least visited part of the river, here is always a big chance to catch trophy fish. In the middle of summer a water temperature here usually less on 2-3 degrees than in lower parts of the river. It positively affects activity of fishes, especially in hot days in the middle of summer. Here is the largest population of graylings.
<br/>
Fishing on Chavange is organised as well as on other salmon rivers under licences.
